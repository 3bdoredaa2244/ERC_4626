## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the ERC-4626 standard, which specifies a tokenized vault interface for yield-bearing tokens, allowing interoperability across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and standardized access to yield-bearing vaults.

### Key Features
- **Compliant with ERC-4626**: Standardized interface for tokenized vaults.
- **Yield Generation**: Utilizes DeFi strategies to accumulate yield on deposited assets.
- **Interoperable with ERC-20**: Uses the ERC-20 interface for seamless integration with tokens.
